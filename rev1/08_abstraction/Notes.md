# 📘 Java Revision – Phase 8: Abstraction (Abstract Class)

Abstraction means:
> **Show WHAT a class must do, hide HOW it does it**

Java uses **abstract classes** to enforce rules on child classes.

## 🧠 Why Abstraction is Needed

Problem:
- You know *every* shape must have an area
- But you don't know the formula in advance

You cannot write incomplete logic in normal classes.

Solution:
👉 **Abstract class**

## 🧩 What is an Abstract Class?

> An abstract class is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and may contain **abstract methods**.

- Abstract methods have **no body**
- Child classes **must implement** them
